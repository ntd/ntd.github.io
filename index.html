<h2>Cross-compiling gobject-introspection</h2>
<p><small>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 08:42:21 +0100</small></p>
<p>
The cross compilation of
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection">gobject-introspection</a>
from linux to mingw has been proved a really tough task. That project
seems an octopus connected <b>at runtime</b> to different part of the
system: python, pkg-config, a shell, dlltool and cc. On a standard unix
based system all those tools are already installed but when
cross-compiling you must build every single piece by yourself.
</p>

<p>
My first approach was to build everything on the host side (i.e. on
<a href="http://mingw-w64.yaxm.org/doku.php">mingw-w64</a>). I still
think this is the correct way (after all I need to add introspection for
packages installed on the host side) but after a lot of trial and error
(more errors than trials) I gave up. I was bound continuosly from the
build side to the host side and vice versa because of path format,
filename mangling and requirements. When I realized I had to build gcc
on the host I was fed up. I just tried a
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/">precompiled binary</a>
and definitively gave up after the umpteenth error.
</p>

<p>
The second approach was to leverage the tools on the build system by
configuring them to work with the paths of the host system. It was not
straight-forward but surely much more easier than the previous attempt
and, above all, succesful!
</p>

<p>
The main problem was to build the giscanner python module for the build
platform. I resolved building the project twice, as already done by
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=592311#c20">Nicolas
Dufresne</a> when cross-compiling for other arch. I then leveraged
<a href="https://www.winehq.org/">wine</a> to run host programs on the
build side.
</p>

<p>
The changes on gobject-introspection are relatively few and unobtrusive.
They can be pulled from my
<a href="https://github.com/ntd/gobject-introspection/tree/xbuild">xbuild branch</a>.
</p>

<p>
The build is still not as straight-forward as I would. I used a
variation of the following (untested) procedure.
</p>

<pre>
export CC=$arch-gcc
export PKG_CONFIG=$arch-pkg-config
export DLLTOOL=$arch-dlltool
export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2
export GI_OS_NAME=nt
export INTROSPECTION_LAUNCHER="/usr/bin/env WINEARCH=win$bits WINEPREFIX=$srcdir/win$bits DISPLAY= /usr/bin/wine"
export XDG_DATA_DIRS="/usr/$arch/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS"
export GI_TYPELIB_PATH="/usr/$arch/lib/girepository-1.0:$GI_TYPELIB_PATH"

# First pass: build the giscanner Python module with build == host
./configure \
    --disable-silent-rules \
    --enable-shared \
    --enable-static
make scannerparser.c _giscanner.la

# Second pass: build everything else with build != host (i.e. cross-compile)
./configure \
  --build=... \
  --host=... \
  --prefix=... \
  --disable-silent-rules \
  --enable-shared \
  --enable-static \
  --disable-doctool \
  --disable-giscanner

# Avoid overriding what built in the first pass
make -t scannerparser.c _giscanner.la

make INTROSPECTION_LAUNCHER="$INTROSPECTION_LAUNCHER"
</pre>

<p>
In the real world I built the project on ArchLinux as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ntd/aur-fedora-mingw">a toolchain</a> for
cross-compiling GTK+2 and GTK+3 applications. The build script can be
browsed on its
<a href="https://github.com/ntd/aur-fedora-mingw/blob/master/afm-mingw-w64-gobject-introspection/PKGBUILD">dedicated PKGBUILD</a>.

<h2>Offsetting cubic Bézier curves</h2>
<p><small>Sun, 26 Oct 2014 07:57:11 +0100</small></p>
<p>
While working on the <a href="http://adg.entidi.com/">ADG</a>, we
implemented <a href="assets/baioca.pdf">BAIOCA</a>, a new algorithm for
offsetting Bézier cubic curves. It finds the offset curve by imposing
some obvious constraint and by minimizing the mean square error between
the original curve and the offset curve at the <b>same time value</b>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="assets/baioca.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="BAIOCA algorithm">
</p>

<p>
By visually inspecting the results, it seems the algorithm performs
better than <a href="assets/handcraft.pdf">handcraft</a> (the previous
algorithm) in the edge cases (latest 4 images on the screenshots) but
overall it performs worse on the other cases (above all, image 2 and 4).
</p>

<p>
<img src="assets/handcraft.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="Handcraft algorithm">
</p>

<p>
I think the algorithm is theoretical correct but the additional phantom
constraint <q>at the same time value</q> (implied to be able to solve
the system) must be blamed. This is confirmed by the fact that when
increasing the samples the offset curve must fit, the quality of the
result decreases. This counterintuitive behavior makes sense if you
think that additional phantom constraints worsen the result.

<h2>Optimization of array cycles in Lua</h2>
<p><small>Sun, 07 Sep 2014 09:35:41 +0200</small></p>
<p>
A common pattern is to use Lua tables as arrays: there is no other data structure so
the choice is imposed. This does not usually pose any problem apart the fact you
cannot store <a href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/StoringNilsInTables"><code>nil</code>
values in tables</a> blindly.
</p>

<p>
However, when populating with millions of items, using Lua tables becomes a
performance issue because the length operator has <b>O(n)</b> complexity.
<code>table.insert</code>, the obvious candidate for such operation, has the worse
performance. Directly using <code>v[#v+1]</code> avoids a call but still suffers from
the O(n) problem. The proper solution is to avoid relying on the lengh operator by
keeping a separate pointer or directly use the iterator variable of the cycle.
</p>

<pre>
$ time lua -e 'a = {} for n = 1, 10000000 do table.insert(a, n) end'

real    0m3.218s
user    0m3.173s
sys 0m0.040s
$ time lua -e 'a = {} for n = 1, 10000000 do a[#a+1] = n end'

real    0m2.656s
user    0m2.623s
sys 0m0.027s
$ time lua -e 'a = {} for n = 1, 10000000 do a[n] = n end'

<h2>luarocks 2.0.13 for Debian</h2>
<p><small>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 22:44:54 +0200</small></p>
<p>
Lately I am working quite intensively with the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
programming language. I will have to deploy the final system on different linux
distros, mostly <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> 7 (Wheezy) 64 bits, so I
decided to install it together with the Lua packages it depends on by leveraging the
natural deployment system provided by the Lua ecosystem, that is
<a href="http://www.luarocks.org/">LuaRocks</a>.
</p>
<p>
In short: the official LuaRocks package found in Debian repositories is 2.0.9 and it
has a bug that prevented me to use it successfully. I rebuilt and packaged LuaRocks
for Debian Wheezy using the latest compatible release (2.0.13) leaving almost all the
old settings but depending on Lua 5.2 instead of Lua 5.1. Hopefully it will be useful
to others.
